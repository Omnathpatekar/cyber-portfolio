# Day 09 â€” Bandit Level 8 â†’ 9
**Date:** 2025-09-09

## ðŸ”‘ Level Goal
Log into `bandit8` and find the password for `bandit9`. The password is the **only line** in `data.txt` that appears **once**.

## ðŸ›  Commands used
```bash
# SSH into bandit8
ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

# Find the unique line (password) in data.txt
sort data.txt | uniq -u

ðŸ“Œ Why it works (short)

sort data.txt â€” arranges all lines so duplicates are adjacent.

uniq -u â€” prints only lines that appear exactly once.

Together: returns the single unique password line.
